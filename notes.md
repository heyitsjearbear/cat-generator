# AI-Powered Cat Generation Project

## Introduction
Welcome to the AI-Powered Cat Generation Project! This innovative endeavor uses cutting-edge artificial intelligence (OPENAI API) to generate cat images.

## Project Goals
- To create an accessible interface where users can interact with the AI and receive images.
- Get myself familiar with fullstack development

## Technology Stack
- Backend: Node.js
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Database: MongoDB

# To-Do List

## Phase 1: Research and Infrastructure Setup
- [ ] Research on OpenAI's assistance API for potential integration.
- [X] Set up the initial project repository and documentation.
- [X] Choose the tech stack for front-end, back-end, and database.

## Phase 2: Front-End Development
- [ ] Implement the front-end React components for the login/sign-in page.
- [ ] Ensure proper state management and validation for user input on the front-end.

## Phase 3: Back-End Development
- [ ] Develop the REST API endpoints using Node.js or another preferred server-side language.
- [ ] Set up MongoDB and create the following schemas:
    - [ ] User Schema: To store user information and authentication details.
    - [ ] Cat Picture Schema: To store individual cat image details.
    - [ ] Cat Picture List Schema: To store lists or collections of cat pictures.
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization logic for user accounts.

## Phase 4: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate the front-end with the back-end services.
- [ ] Test the REST API endpoints with the front-end interface.
- [ ] Write unit and integration tests for both the front-end and back-end.

## Phase 5: Refinement and Launch Preparation
- [ ] Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback.
- [ ] Optimize the performance of the back-end, especially the database interactions.
- [ ] Prepare marketing materials and plan for the launch.

## Phase 6: Launch and Post-Launch Activities
- [ ] Deploy the application to a production environment.
- [ ] Monitor the application's performance and user feedback.
- [ ] Iterate on the application based on user feedback and analytics.

# Development Notes

## Day 1: [12/4/2023]
- Set up the project repository and decided on the technology stack.
- Worked on sign in page design and implementing in front end

## Day 2: [?]
- Plan to work on getting a similar looking 'sign up' page
- transition: sign in disappears, sign up shows up
